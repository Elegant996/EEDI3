# EEDI3

This is a port of firesledge's EEDI3 mod so that it works with both x86 and x64.

### Requirements

This filter requires AviSynth 2.6.0 or AviSynth+ as well as the Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2013.

### Syntax and Parameters

The syntax and parameters are identical to the original EEDI3. To see a list refer to this [link](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Eedi3).

### Changes

* Switched to AVS 2.6 API
* Added x64 support
* Updated some variable types for clarity

### Programmer Notes

This program was compiled using Visual Studio 2013 and falls under the GNU General Public License.

I would like to thank cretindesalpes/firesledge and jpsdr for their work on EEDI3 and NNEDI3 (respectively) as this project was made as a result of their efforts.
